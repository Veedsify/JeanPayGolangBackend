# Frontend Route Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the frontend route corrections made to ensure email links point to the correct pages in the JeanPay application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Deposit Route Correction
**Problem**: Email templates were using `/dashboard/deposit` 
**Solution**: Changed to `/dashboard/topup`
**Reason**: The actual frontend route for deposits/topups is `/dashboard/topup`

### 2. Currency Conversion Route Correction
**Problem**: Email templates were using `/dashboard/convert` (non-existent route)
**Solution**: Changed to `/dashboard/transactions`
**Reason**: Currency conversion doesn't have a dedicated retry page, so users are directed to transaction history instead

## Updated Routes

### Transaction Rejection Email Routes
For rejected transactions, users are now directed to the correct retry pages:

- **Deposits/Topups**: `/dashboard/topup` - "Try Deposit Again"
- **Withdrawals**: `/dashboard/withdraw` - "Try Withdrawal Again" 
- **Transfers**: `/dashboard/transfer` - "Try Transfer Again"
- **Conversions**: `/dashboard/transactions` - "View Transaction History"

### Transaction Approval Email Routes
For approved transactions, users are consistently directed to:

- **All Transaction Types**: `/dashboard/transactions` - "View Transaction History"

## Files Modified

### 1. `templates/TransactionRejected.go`
```go
// Fixed deposit route
baseData["ActionPath"] = "topup"  // was "deposit"

// Fixed conversion route  
baseData["ActionPath"] = "transactions"  // was "convert"
baseData["ActionButtonText"] = "View Transaction History"  // was "Try Conversion Again"
```

### 2. `docs/URL_STANDARDIZATION.md`
Updated documentation to reflect correct frontend routes:
- Changed `/dashboard/deposit` to `/dashboard/topup`
- Removed `/dashboard/convert` (non-existent route)

## Email Flow Examples

### Rejected Deposit Email
```
Subject: Deposit Rejected - JeanPay
Content: "Unable to verify payment method..."
Action Button: "Try Deposit Again" → /dashboard/topup
```

### Rejected Conversion Email
```
Subject: Currency Conversion Rejected - JeanPay
Content: "Unable to process conversion..."
Action Button: "View Transaction History" → /dashboard/transactions
```

### Approved Transfer Email
```
Subject: Transfer Approved - JeanPay
Content: "Transfer completed successfully..."
Action Button: "View Transaction History" → /dashboard/transactions
```

## Benefits

1. **Correct Navigation**: Users are directed to existing frontend pages
2. **Better UX**: Deposit rejections lead directly to the topup page for retry
3. **Fallback Handling**: Non-existent conversion retry page replaced with transaction history
4. **Consistency**: All approved transactions lead to transaction history

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test rejected deposit email → should redirect to `/dashboard/topup`
- [ ] Test rejected withdrawal email → should redirect to `/dashboard/withdraw`
- [ ] Test rejected transfer email → should redirect to `/dashboard/transfer`
- [ ] Test rejected conversion email → should redirect to `/dashboard/transactions`
- [ ] Test any approved transaction email → should redirect to `/dashboard/transactions`

## Future Considerations

If a dedicated currency conversion retry page is added in the future:
1. Create the `/dashboard/convert` route in the frontend
2. Update `TransactionRejected.go` to use the new route:
   ```go
   baseData["ActionPath"] = "convert"
   baseData["ActionButtonText"] = "Try Conversion Again"
   ```
